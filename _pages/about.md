Hello! 

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto studying computer science and math. 
Academically, I am interested in the intersection of machine learning and the life sciences, and in my spare time, I enjoy 
digital painting.

Currently, I am fortunate to be part-time (previously, co-op) at [Deep Genomics](https://www.deepgenomics.com/) as a machine learning research intern. 
Previously, I have worked with [Mario Krenn](https://mariokrenn.wordpress.com/) and Professor [Al√°n Aspuru-Guzik](https://www.matter.toronto.edu/) on the SELFIES string-based molecular representation, 
and [Juhan Bae](https://www.juhanbae.com/) and Professor [Roger Grosse](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/) on influence functions (funded by NSERC USRA). 


Please find attached my CV and transcript below.
