Hello!

I am an incoming PhD student at MIT. Academically, I am interested in the intersection of machine
learning and the life sciences, and in my spare time, I enjoy digital painting. 

Previously, I recieved my HBSc degree from the University of Toronto. There, I was fortunate to
co-op at [Deep Genomics](https://www.deepgenomics.com/) as a machine learning research intern. I
also worked with [Austin Cheng](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~austin/), [Mario
Krenn](https://mariokrenn.wordpress.com/), and Prof. [Al√°n
Aspuru-Guzik](https://www.matter.toronto.edu/) on structure elucidation from rotational spectra and
the SELFIES molecular representation. I also had the privilige of working with [Juhan
Bae](https://www.juhanbae.com/) and Prof. [Roger Grosse](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/)
on influence functions (funded by NSERC USRA).
