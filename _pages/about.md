Hello!

I am a PhD student at MIT CSAIL supervised by Prof. [Wojciech Matusik](https://cdfg.mit.edu/wojciech).
Academically, I am interested in the intersection of machine learning and the life sciences, and in
my spare time, I enjoy digital painting.

Previously, I received my HBSc degree from the University of Toronto. There, I was fortunate to
be on co-op at [Deep Genomics](https://www.deepgenomics.com/) as a machine learning research intern.
At Prof. [Alán Aspuru-Guzik's](https://www.matter.toronto.edu/) lab, I worked with
[Austin Cheng](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~austin/) on structure elucidation from rotational spectra
and [Mario Krenn](https://mariokrenn.wordpress.com/) on the SELFIES molecular representation, both of
whom I learned a lot from.
I also had the privilege of working with [Juhan Bae](https://www.juhanbae.com/) and
Prof. [Roger Grosse](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/) on influence functions,
funded by NSERC USRA.
